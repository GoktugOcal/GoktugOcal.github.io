Technical Dept is a metaphor that stands for the extra cost that arises in the long term that a team faces and results by selecting easy and quick delivery options instead of optimal development, or missing crucial points in action. The term was first mentioned by Ward Cunningham in 1992 \cite{[https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/157710.157715](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/157710.157715)}. Cunningham described an anology as;

> Shipping first-time code is like going into debt. A little debt speeds development so long as it is paid back promptly with a rewrite.

and explained the technical debt as trade-off between producing clean code at a greater cost and later delivery vs writing sloppy code quickly and cheaply at the expense of more maintenance work once it is released.

> It is dangerous to think that quick wins of building complex ML-based prediction systems as coming for free

The technical debt for Machine Learning(ML) systems exists in system level instead of the code level therefore the traditional approach in technical debt as in software development is not enough and ML-specific approaches need to be discussed.
