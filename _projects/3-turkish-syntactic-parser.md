title: "Turkish Syntactic Parser"
description: "Syntactic parsing is the process of analyzing a sentence or a piece of text and determining its grammatical structure. This includes identifying the constituent phrases and dependencies between the words, as well as determining the roles played by each word in the sentence (such as the subject, verb, and object). In this project, we have developed a Turkish Language CKY Parser which is fed from Chomsky's Normal Form (CNF) grammar rules and a lexicon. The process of parsing and the generation of CNF rules and lexicon are described."
