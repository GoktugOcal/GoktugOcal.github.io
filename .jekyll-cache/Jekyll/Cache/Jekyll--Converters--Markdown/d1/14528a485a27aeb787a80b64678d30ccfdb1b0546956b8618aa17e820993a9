  <p>First of all, this blog post is inspired by the paper “Why AI is Harder Than We Think?” whose author is <a href="https://www.santafe.edu/people/profile/melanie-mitchell">Melanie Mitchell</a> who is a Professor at the Santa Fe University and has numerous pieces of research on artificial intelligence and cognitive science. Mitchell has pointed out four fallacies while interpreting the AI and I really encourage you to read the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.12871">original paper</a>.</p>
